# Linear-vs-Huber-Regression
Linear Regression model works well when the data is normally distributed and free from outliers. However, it can be susceptible to outliers, potentially skewing results and leading to less accurate predictions in the presence of significant outliers. Unlike linear regression, Huber regression uses a hybrid loss function less sensitive to outliers by assigning a quadratic loss to data points close to the prediction and a linear loss to those further away.
